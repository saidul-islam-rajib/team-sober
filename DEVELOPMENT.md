# Development & operations guide

How to run this project locally, set and manage the admin password, and get
unstuck when sign-in misbehaves. For architecture and deployment, see
[README.md](README.md); for a Docker-first walkthrough, see [DOCKER.md](DOCKER.md).

All commands are run from the `automation/` folder unless stated otherwise:

```
cd "c:\Users\Saidul islam rajib.BS-01696\Desktop\Learning\AWS_Demo_Project\automation"
```

## Prerequisites

- Node.js ≥ 20 and npm
- First time only: install dependencies

```bash
npm install
```

---

## Running the app

The app reads its configuration from **environment variables at startup**. Two
matter for local work: `ADMIN_PASSWORD` (without it, admin sign-in is disabled)
and `SESSION_SECRET` (without it, you are signed out on every restart).

Set them, then start — **in the same terminal window, in that order**, because
the variables are read once when the process boots.

### PowerShell (prompt starts with `PS C:\...>`)

```powershell
$env:ADMIN_PASSWORD = "dev-password"
$env:SESSION_SECRET = "dev-secret"
npm run start
```

### Git Bash (prompt shows `MINGW64`)

```bash
export ADMIN_PASSWORD="dev-password"
export SESSION_SECRET="dev-secret"
npm run start
```

Or inline, for a single run:

```bash
ADMIN_PASSWORD="dev-password" SESSION_SECRET="dev-secret" npm run start
```

### Command Prompt (cmd)

```cmd
set ADMIN_PASSWORD=dev-password
set SESSION_SECRET=dev-secret
npm run start
```

> In cmd, do **not** put spaces around `=`. `set ADMIN_PASSWORD = x` creates a
> variable literally named `ADMIN_PASSWORD ` (with a trailing space).

Then open **http://localhost:3000** and sign in at **http://localhost:3000/login**.

Use `npm run start:dev` instead of `npm run start` for watch mode (restarts on
file changes). Note that each restart drops sessions unless `SESSION_SECRET` is
set.

---

## The admin password

There is no stored admin password to look up. The app compares your input
against the `ADMIN_PASSWORD` environment variable of the running process
([`auth.service.ts`](automation/src/auth/auth.service.ts)). Whatever that
variable holds **is** the password — in plain text, only in memory, never
written to disk or logged.

### Set it

Use the block for your shell in [Running the app](#running-the-app). Setting the
variable this way lasts only for the current terminal window; open a new one and
you set it again.

To make it **persist across all new terminals** (PowerShell/cmd), set a user
environment variable once:

```powershell
setx ADMIN_PASSWORD "dev-password"
setx SESSION_SECRET "dev-secret"
```

`setx` writes to your Windows user profile. It takes effect in **newly opened**
terminals, not the one you ran it in. Remove them later with:

```powershell
[Environment]::SetEnvironmentVariable("ADMIN_PASSWORD", $null, "User")
[Environment]::SetEnvironmentVariable("SESSION_SECRET", $null, "User")
```

### See it

Read the variable back **in the same window where you set it**:

| Shell | Command |
|---|---|
| PowerShell | `$env:ADMIN_PASSWORD` |
| Git Bash | `echo "$ADMIN_PASSWORD"` |
| cmd | `echo %ADMIN_PASSWORD%` |
| Docker container | `docker exec blog printenv ADMIN_PASSWORD` |
| Deployed server | `grep ADMIN_PASSWORD /opt/blog/.env` |

If it prints nothing, the variable is not set in that shell — which also means a
server launched from that shell has no password and shows *"ADMIN_PASSWORD is not
set on the server, so sign-in is disabled."*

If you set it in one window but ran `npm run start` in another, the app never
received it. Set and start in the same window.

### Clear or change it

There is nothing to "reset" — the password is just the current value of the
variable. To change it, set a new value and restart the app so the new process
reads it:

```powershell
# stop the running server(s)
Get-Process node -ErrorAction SilentlyContinue | Stop-Process -Force

# set the new password and start again
$env:ADMIN_PASSWORD = "a-new-password"
$env:SESSION_SECRET = "dev-secret"
npm run start
```

Because sign-in only ever checks the current variable, there is no old password
lingering to conflict with. Existing admin sessions are signed out when the
`SESSION_SECRET` changes; keeping the same secret keeps you signed in across the
restart.

## Environment variables

| Variable | Default | Purpose |
|---|---|---|
| `ADMIN_PASSWORD` | — | Admin sign-in password. **Unset disables admin sign-in.** |
| `AUTH_SECRET` | development key | HMAC key for learner session cookies. Must be **32+ characters**, and **identical across every Team Sober app** — that is what makes single sign-on work. |
| `SESSION_SECRET` | random per boot | Legacy name for the same thing, still read when `AUTH_SECRET` is unset. Prefer `AUTH_SECRET`. |
| `SSO_COOKIE_DOMAIN` | unset | Set to `.team-sober.com` in production so the session cookie is visible to every subdomain. Leave unset locally. |
| `DATA_DIR` | `./data` | Where JSON data and uploads are written. Point elsewhere for a throwaway run. |
| `PORT` | `3000` | Port the app listens on. |
| `TRUST_PROXY` | unset | Set to `1` only when behind a reverse proxy (see [README → Security](README.md#security)). |

### Email

Registration emails a link to set a password, so without SMTP nobody can
finish signing up. The variable names match the Bachelor Point project, so one
block of `.env` configures either.

| Variable | Default | Purpose |
|---|---|---|
| `SMTP_HOST` | — | Unset keeps the mailer in preview mode: nothing is sent, and the link is logged to the server console instead. |
| `SMTP_PORT` | `587` | `465` is treated as implicit TLS; anything else negotiates STARTTLS. |
| `SMTP_USER` | — | Unset skips authentication entirely. |
| `SMTP_PASSWORD` | — | For Gmail this is a 16-character app password, not the account password. |
| `SMTP_FROM` | — | e.g. `Team Sober <admin@team-sober.com>`. Required, along with `SMTP_HOST`, before anything is sent. |
| `SMTP_TIMEOUT_MS` | `15000` | How long to wait on the conversation before giving up. |

**In development you do not need SMTP.** With no `SMTP_HOST` set, nothing is
sent and the link is written to the server console instead
(`this.logger.debug` in [`mailer.service.ts`](automation/src/shared/mail/mailer.service.ts)),
so the whole sign-up flow is walkable offline by copying the link out of the
terminal running `npm run start`/`docker logs`. The "check your email" page
itself never displays the link, in development or production.

A clean-slate local run, writing to a temporary data folder on a spare port:

```powershell
$env:ADMIN_PASSWORD = "dev-password"
$env:AUTH_SECRET = "a-local-development-secret-of-at-least-32-chars"
$env:PORT = "3001"
$env:DATA_DIR = "$env:TEMP\blog-dev-data"
npm run start
```

Delete the `DATA_DIR` folder to start from empty (removes posts, accounts,
uploads, settings and platform configuration).

## Single sign-on across the Team Sober apps

Every Team Sober application is served from a subdomain of `team-sober.com`
and signs its session cookie with the same `AUTH_SECRET`. A cookie set on the
parent domain is therefore readable by all of them, and each can verify a
session another one issued. There are no redirects and no authorisation codes,
and one app being down never stops another signing somebody in.

```
                cookie ts_identity, Domain=.team-sober.com
                signed HMAC-SHA256 with the shared AUTH_SECRET

   team-sober.com  ──┐                    ┌──  mess.team-sober.com
                     ├── both read it ────┤
   sign in on one ───┘                    └───  already signed in on the other
```

The cookie carries `{ sub, email, name, iss, sv, iat, exp }`:

- **`sub`** is derived from the address (`sha256(namespace:email)`), so the
  same person has the same identifier in every app without the apps ever
  needing to agree on one, or share a database.
- **`iss`** says which app minted it.
- **`sv`** is the *issuer's* token version. Only the issuer holds the record it
  counts against, so a consumer ignores it. That is why a password change
  signs you out of the app you changed it in, but not the others.

When this app sees a valid session it did not issue, it creates a local
account for that address on the spot — active, but with no local password.
The learner can set one from their account page whenever they want to sign in
here directly.

Two things to get right in production:

1. `AUTH_SECRET` must be **byte-identical** in every app. Rotate them together
   or everybody is signed out.
2. `SSO_COOKIE_DOMAIN` must be `.team-sober.com`, with a leading dot.

Locally, leave `SSO_COOKIE_DOMAIN` unset. The cookie is then host-only, so a
session on `localhost:3000` does not leak to another app on `localhost:3001`.

## Learner accounts vs the admin password

Three separate things — do not confuse them:

- **Site owner password** (`/login`) — the single shared login, controlled by
  the `ADMIN_PASSWORD` environment variable. No self-service recovery; you
  change it by changing the variable.
- **Admin accounts** (`/login`, with an email) — individual email + password
  logins for people who administer the site, managed from **Admin → Admins**
  (`/admin/admins`) by anyone already signed in. Unlike the site owner
  password, these can be listed, added, have their password reset, or have
  their email changed without touching environment variables or restarting
  the server. See [`admins.service.ts`](automation/src/admins/admins.service.ts).
- **Learner accounts** (`/account`) — visitors register with a name and an
  email address only. A one-time link is emailed to them; following it is both
  how they choose a password and how the address is proved, so an account
  cannot be signed into until the link is used. "Forgotten your password"
  emails the same kind of link. If a learner can no longer read the mailbox on
  their account, the owner can issue a one-time reset code by hand from
  **Admin → Accounts** (`/admin/accounts`) — that is the only remaining
  recovery-code path. Operational limits live under
  **Admin → Settings → Platform configuration**.

See [README → Learner accounts and recovery](README.md#learner-accounts-and-recovery)
for the full recovery model.

## Troubleshooting sign-in

Match the symptom to the cause:

| What you see | Cause | Fix |
|---|---|---|
| *"ADMIN_PASSWORD is not set…"* | The running process has no password — usually a **stale server** from an earlier session still holding port 3000, or the variable was set in a different window than `npm run start`. | Stop all node processes and start fresh (below). |
| *"Incorrect password."* | The app has a password, but your input does not match. | Confirm with `$env:ADMIN_PASSWORD` in the launching window. Watch for a trailing space or a value set with `=` spaced (cmd). |
| *"Too many failed attempts."* | The rate limiter locked your address after repeated failures. | Wait for the lockout window, or restart the app to clear it. The threshold and lockout length are configurable under Admin → Settings. |
| Page will not load / connection refused | The app is not running. | Check the `npm run start` terminal for an error such as `EADDRINUSE` (port already taken). |

**The reliable reset** — stop everything, confirm the port is free, then set and
start in one window:

```powershell
# 1. Stop any running node servers
Get-Process node -ErrorAction SilentlyContinue | Stop-Process -Force

# 2. Confirm port 3000 is free (prints nothing when free)
Get-NetTCPConnection -LocalPort 3000 -ErrorAction SilentlyContinue

# 3. Set the password and start, in this same window
cd "c:\Users\Saidul islam rajib.BS-01696\Desktop\Learning\AWS_Demo_Project\automation"
$env:ADMIN_PASSWORD = "dev-password"
$env:SESSION_SECRET = "dev-secret"
npm run start
```

Then sign in at **http://localhost:3000/login** with `dev-password`.

**Confirm the running server actually has a password** without using the browser:

```powershell
# 200 = a real page; the same request against a passwordless server still 200s,
# so also grep the sign-in page text:
(Invoke-WebRequest http://localhost:3000/login -UseBasicParsing).Content `
  -match 'ADMIN_PASSWORD is not set'
```

`True` means the server is running **without** a password (stale or wrongly
launched); `False` means the password is set and you should be able to sign in.
